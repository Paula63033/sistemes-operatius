    * No. Penny kissed me.
    * You'll never guess what just happened.
  - Penny
    * Because I'm stupid. 
  - Raj
    * I don't like bugs, okay. They freak me out.
  - Sheldon
    * Interesting. You're afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic.
    * Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
    * That's no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid, and that makes me sad.
    * Who would ever guess that?
    * Why are you crying? 
    * You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an inter-dimensional portal, which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back, to bring us all with you to the year 7010, where we are transported to work at the think-a-torium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?

    * All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don’t input those numbers… it doesn’t make much of a difference.
    * Ok, the fifth dentist caved and now they’re ALL recommending Trident?
    * WHOOOPAH!
  - Janice
    * Oh… my… God!
  - Joey
    * Here come the meat sweats…
    * Hey, I’m not judgin’!
    * Hey, Ross, I got a science question
    * Sure I peed on her. And if I had to, I’d pee on any one of you!
    * Well, I’m sorry if I’m not a middle-aged black woman. And I’m also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition.
    * Yeah.
  - Monica
    * Welcome to the real world. It sucks. You’re gonna love it!
  - Phoebe
    * Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
    * He must decide. He must decide. Even though I made him up, he must decide!
  - Rachel
    * Guys, guess what?!
    * How long do cats live? Like assuming you don’t throw ‘em under a bus or something?
  - Ross
    * Joey, homo sapiens are PEOPLE.
    * Well, instead of a jacket, it’s a pile of garbage. And instead of a chair, it’s a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it’s the end of time and garbage is all that has survived.
    * Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
    * You know how you come home at the end of the day and throw your jacket on a chair?
  - Susan
    * Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise they don’t let you do it.
