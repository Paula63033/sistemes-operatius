Friends:Monica:Welcome to the real world. It sucks. You’re gonna love it!
Friends:Janice:Oh… my… God!
Friends:Rachel:How long do cats live? Like assuming you don’t throw ‘em under a bus or something?
Friends:Ross:You know how you come home at the end of the day and throw your jacket on a chair?
Friends:Joey:Yeah.
Friends:Ross:Well, instead of a jacket, it’s a pile of garbage. And instead of a chair, it’s a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it’s the end of time and garbage is all that has survived.
Friends:Rachel:Guys, guess what?!
Friends:Chandler:Ok, the fifth dentist caved and now they’re ALL recommending Trident?
Friends:Chandler:WHOOOPAH!
Friends:Joey:Sure I peed on her. And if I had to, I’d pee on any one of you!
Friends:Phoebe:He must decide. He must decide. Even though I made him up, he must decide!
Friends:Joey:Here come the meat sweats…
Friends:Ross:Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
Friends:Susan:Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise they don’t let you do it.
Friends:Chandler:All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don’t input those numbers… it doesn’t make much of a difference.
Friends:Joey:Well, I’m sorry if I’m not a middle-aged black woman. And I’m also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition.
Friends:Joey:Hey, Ross, I got a science question: If the homo sapiens were, in fact, HOMO sapiens…is that why they’re extinct?”

Friends:Joey:Hey, I’m not judgin’!
Friends:Phoebe:Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.

BigBangTheory:Sheldon:Why are you crying? 
BigBangTheory:Penny:Because I'm stupid. 
BigBangTheory:Sheldon:That's no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid, and that makes me sad.
BigBangTheory:Raj:I don't like bugs, okay. They freak me out.
BigBangTheory:Sheldon:Interesting. You're afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic.
BigBangTheory:Leonard:You'll never guess what just happened.
BigBangTheory:Sheldon:You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an inter-dimensional portal, which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back, to bring us all with you to the year 7010, where we are transported to work at the think-a-torium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins? 
BigBangTheory:Leonard:No. Penny kissed me.
BigBangTheory:Sheldon:Who would ever guess that?
Z:Leonard:OMG! This is a fake quote.
